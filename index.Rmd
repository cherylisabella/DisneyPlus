Data preparation before import into STP.rmd:

- The data has been scanned for potential outliers and misspecified data. During this process, 14 respondents were discarded (e.g., due to a failed attention check, misunderstanding of (a) question(s), etc.).
- Also, the data has been checked for multicollinearity and highly correlated variables were deleted for further analysis.
- Due to the small sample size, some data entries had to be duplicated.
- Moreover, the present data has already been reduced such as that multi-item scales, e.g., price consciousness, have been combined (please also see the information on the Cronbachs Alpha in the variable table).
- For selected variables, the standardized values (mean = 0, SD = 1) are also included in the data set (indicated by the Z added in front of the variable name).
